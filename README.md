# Multiple Linear Regression Project

## Project Description
This project implements a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to analyze and predict student performance based on study habits and sleep patterns. The model is trained using a dataset containing weekly study hours, hours of sleep, and marks obtained. The workflow includes data preprocessing, training/testing, predictions, and visual analysis to evaluate model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following variables:
- **Hours in Week**: Total hours spent studying per week.
- **Slept Hours**: Average hours of sleep per day.
- **Marks Obtained**: Exam scores achieved by the student.

## Activities Performed
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Train and Test Model**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict marks based on study and sleep hours.
- **Plot Autocorrelation**: Visualizing autocorrelation in the dataset.
- **Shifted Time Lag Data**: Creating lagged variables to explore temporal dependencies in the data.
